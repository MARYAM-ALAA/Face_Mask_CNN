# Face Mask Detection 

This project was developed as part of the **Computer Vision (90 hrs)** training at the **Information Technology Institute (ITI)**.  
It is an **AI model** that detects whether a person in an image is **wearing a face mask or not**.

---

## 📌 Overview
- Built an image classification model using **Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras**.  
- The model predicts two classes:
  - **Mask**
  - **No Mask**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python 3.8+  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy & Pandas  
- Matplotlib
